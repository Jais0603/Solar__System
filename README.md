Introduction
The provided HTML and CSS code creates an interactive animation that depicts the following celestial bodies:

Sun: Represented as a yellow circle at the center of the screen.
Earth: Represented as a blue circle orbiting the sun. The Earth's rotation is animated to give the illusion of orbit.
Moon: Represented as a silver circle orbiting the Earth. The moon's rotation is also animated, showing its orbit around the Earth.
This project serves as an educational tool to visually demonstrate the concept of planetary motion and the relative orbits of celestial bodies in our solar system.

Features
Realistic visual representation of the sun, Earth, and moon.
Smooth and continuous rotation animations for Earth and the moon.
Clear and concise HTML and CSS code for easy understanding and modification.
